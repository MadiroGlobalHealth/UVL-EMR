This project is part of **Madiro's HealthTech Challenge 2024** connecting passionate people willing to engage in **Global Goods for Digital Health** with real-life needs and impactful opportunities. 

This repository contains a distribution of **OpenMRS 3** that will support UVL in its digitalization of clinical operations (patient registration, consultations, laboratory, pharmacy, reporting, billing, etc.). Implementing a Digital Public Good such as OpenMRS in a rural hospital in Burundi is key for improving patient care through better record-keeping and streamlined medical data management such as laboratory test results or drug prescriptions, ensuring that healthcare providers have accurate and up-to-date information. 

Additionally, it facilitates efficient tracking of public health trends and resource allocation, which is essential for addressing the unique healthcare challenges in rural settings. For example, the financial support from the government for child care and maternal care is conditional to digitalization - contributing to the long-term **viability and independence** of the hospital.

## Quick Start using GitPod
You can run the project and contribute to it using GitPod in your browser or VSCode. This will allow you to easily run the project without installing dependencies on your local machine like Java SDK, Docker, etc.  

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/MadiroGlobalHealth/UVL-EMR/)

## Quick Start on localhost

### Prerequisites

1. Install or update [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Install or update [JAVA SDK](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/downloads/) 
3. Install or update [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) (version ‚â• 2.29)

### Clone and Install

Clone the repository locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MadiroGlobalHealth/UVL-EMR.git
```

Open the cloned folder
```bash
cd UVL-EMR
```
Add your GitHub credentials to `~/.m2/settings.xml` settings file. See [how to create a git github token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token)
```xml
<servers>

    <id>madiro-global-health-github-uvl-emr</id>
    <username>your_github_username</username>
    <password>your_github_token</password>
  </server>
</servers>
```

Build UVL distro/version of OpenMRS 3
```bash
./scripts/mvnw clean package
```

### Run and Open

Run UVL EMR (Mugamba polyclinic)
```bash
cd sites/mugamba/target/ozone-uvl-mugamba-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/run/docker/scripts
./start-demo.sh
```

Open **UVL EMR for end-users** (OpenMRS 3) in your browser (the installation can take a few minutes)
```bash
open http://localhost/
```

Open the **administration of UVL EMR** in your browser 
```bash
open http://localhost/openmrs/admin
```

Note that the default admin user is `admin` and the password is `Admin123`.

### Maven configuration
Sometimes, you might need to customize your Maven configuration file to build the project. 

On Mac, you can edit those settings using:
``vi ~/.m2/settings.xml``

Add the Maven Server config and API key in your Maven settings on your laptop:
```bash
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>madiroglobalhealth-github-uvl-emr</id>
      <username>YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME</username>
      <password>YOU_GITHUB_PASSWORD</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
```
